# Chromium extension boilerplate

This repository aims at being a starting point for developing a chromium extension.

It's as minimalistic as possible, but comes with pre-configured:

- autocompletion for `manifest.json`
- TypeScript transpilation from `ts` folder to `dist` directory
- types for `chrome` namespace
- properly working `export`ing and `import`ing (with VS Code workspace setting for correct auto import format)
- example `manifest.json`

Happy coding!
